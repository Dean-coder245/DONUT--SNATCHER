# üì± Donut Snatcher - Mobile Setup Guide

Your game is now configured as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that works on iOS and Android!

## üöÄ How to Make It Accessible on Mobile

To use Donut Snatcher on mobile devices, you need to host it online with HTTPS. Here are your options:

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (FREE & Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   cd "donut-snatcher/Donut Snatcher"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Mobile-ready PWA"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new repo on GitHub first, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/donut-snatcher.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repo settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Select "Deploy from branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click Save

4. **Access your game**:
   - Your game will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/donut-snatcher/`
   - Share this URL with anyone!

### Option 2: Netlify (FREE & Easy)

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd "donut-snatcher/Donut Snatcher"
   netlify deploy
   # Follow prompts, then run:
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

3. You'll get a permanent URL like `https://donut-snatcher-xyz.netlify.app`

### Option 3: Vercel (FREE & Fast)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd "donut-snatcher/Donut Snatcher"
   vercel
   ```

3. You'll get a URL like `https://donut-snatcher.vercel.app`

### Option 4: Local Network Testing

For testing on your local network (same WiFi):

1. **Find your local IP**:
   ```bash
   hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
   ```

2. **Start a server**:
   ```bash
   cd "donut-snatcher/Donut Snatcher"
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Access from mobile**:
   - Open browser on your phone
   - Go to `http://YOUR-LOCAL-IP:8000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: PWA installation only works with HTTPS, so local network testing won't allow "Add to Home Screen".
